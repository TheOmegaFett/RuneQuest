## üîß Technologies

### Backend Technology Stack

| Technology | Version  | Purpose                                          | Alternatives         | License |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------- |
| Node.js    | 16.x+    | JavaScript runtime for server-side execution     | Deno, Bun            | MIT     |
| Express.js | 4.x      | Web framework for building RESTful APIs          | Koa, Fastify, NestJS | MIT     |
| MongoDB    | 5.0+     | NoSQL database for flexible data storage         | PostgreSQL, MySQL    | SSPL    |
| Mongoose   | 6.x      | MongoDB object modeling and schema validation    | Prisma, TypeORM      | MIT     |
| Jest       | 29.x     | Testing framework for unit and integration tests | Mocha, Jasmine       | MIT     |
| Crypto     | Built-in | Password encryption and security                 | bcrypt, Argon2       | MIT     |

### Why These Technologies?

- **Node.js & Express**: Chosen for their robust ecosystem, excellent documentation, and performance characteristics. The non-blocking I/O model is ideal for handling multiple concurrent requests in our application.

- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Selected for flexible schema design that accommodates our diverse data models (runes, readings, users) and evolving requirements. MongoDB's document-based structure aligns perfectly with JSON-like data exchange.

- **Jest**: Provides a zero-configuration testing experience with built-in mocking capabilities, making it ideal for testing both synchronous and asynchronous code.

- **Crypto (Node.js built-in)**: Used for password encryption instead of external libraries to reduce dependencies while maintaining strong security practices.

### Hardware Requirements

- **Server**: Any system capable of running Node.js (minimum 1GB RAM, 1 CPU core)
- **Database**: MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
- **Development**: Modern web browser and code editor
- **Client**: Device with modern web browser support

## ‚ú® Features

- **Learning Module**: Interactive education on Norse runes
- **Puzzle Module**: Engaging rune-based puzzles and challenges
- **Divination Module**: Virtual rune readings with interpretations
- **User Dashboard**: Progress tracking and personalization
- **Authentication**: Secure user account management
- **Achievement System**: Gamified progression with unlockable achievements

## üèÜ Achievement System

The RuneQuest achievement system provides users with goals to strive for while learning about Norse runes, enhancing engagement and motivation through gamification principles.

### How Achievements Work

Each achievement has specific requirements that users must meet to unlock it. When a user completes an action that fulfills these requirements, the achievement is automatically awarded. Achievements award points that contribute to the user's overall score and profile level.

### Achievement Categories

RuneQuest achievements are organized into the following categories:

- **Quiz Achievements**: Awarded for completing quizzes with various difficulty levels
- **Reading Achievements**: Unlocked by reading and completing educational articles
- **Puzzle Achievements**: Earned by solving Norse rune puzzles
- **Collection Achievements**: Granted for learning complete sets of runes
- **Streak Achievements**: Rewarded for consistent daily activity

### Technical Implementation

Achievements are automatically checked and awarded through the progression system. When a user completes an action (quiz, reading, etc.), the system:

1. Records the action in the user's progression record
2. Checks if any achievement requirements are newly met
3. Awards and displays new achievements to the user
4. Updates the user's total points

The achievement system is extensible, allowing new achievements to be added as the application evolves.

## üß™ Testing

RuneQuest includes comprehensive test coverage using Jest. Follow these steps to run the test suite:

### Running Tests

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

This executes all tests in the `src/testing` directory and displays detailed results in the console, including test successes, failures, and execution time.

### Test Structure

The testing framework covers:

- **Unit Tests**: Tests individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies interaction between components
- **Controller Tests**: Validates API endpoint behavior
- **Model Tests**: Ensures data validation and relationships work correctly
- **Middleware Tests**: Confirms request processing functions properly
- **Achievement Tests**: Validates achievement unlocking and user progression tracking

Each component has its own test file following the pattern `componentName.test.js`, making it easy to locate specific tests.

#### Achievement-Specific Tests

The achievement testing suite (`achievement.test.js`) verifies:

- Achievement model validation
- Achievement API endpoints
- Achievement retrieval by ID and category
- Creation of new achievements

The user progression testing suite (`progression.test.js`) validates:

- Recording of user activities
- Proper tracking of progress toward achievements
- Automatic achievement unlocking when requirements are met
- Correct user statistics calculations

### Test Coverage

For a detailed analysis of test coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

This generates a report showing which parts of the codebase are well-tested and which might need additional coverage.

### Adding New Tests

When extending the application with new features, follow these testing principles:

1. Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
2. Ensure every endpoint has corresponding test cases
3. Test both success and error scenarios
4. Mock external dependencies

The existing tests serve as excellent examples for creating new tests that follow the project's conventions.
